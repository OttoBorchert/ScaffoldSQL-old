Only appears to work in Firefox. You must apply the following settings:

- type "about:config" in the address bar and accept "i'll be careful"
- find "security.checkloaduri" in older versions or "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" in newer versions of firefox and change the value to "false"
- restart firefox
